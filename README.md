## Usage

First, go to [ahk official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to install `ahk`(1.33+, please don't use v2 version).

Then, put the [script](./source/index.ahk) and [config file](./source/config.ini) to the same directory and double-click to open the script (you will be prompted whether to apply administrator privileges, select Apply).

Next, just open the game.

Finally, press `Alt + f4` to kill the script.
